# Optimization Algorithms in Java

This project focuses on the implementation of optimization algorithms such as Simulated Annealing (SA) and Tabu Search (TS) to solve complex optimization problems. The algorithms are applied to problems like the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and other combinatorial problems.

## Description

The project includes the following algorithm implementations:

- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: A probabilistic algorithm inspired by the physical process of annealing, used to find an approximation of the optimal solution in combinatorial optimization problems.
- **Tabu Search (TS)**: An iterative algorithm that guides the search through high-quality solutions while avoiding cycles by using short-term memory (tabu).

These algorithms will be used to solve problems such as:

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.
- **Route optimization problems**.
- **Other combinatorial optimization problems**.
